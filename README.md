# About this Dataset
Diabetes is one of the fastest growing chronic life threatening diseases that have already affected  422  million people worldwide according to the report of World Health Organization (WHO), in  2018 . Due to the presence of a relatively long asymptomatic phase, early detection of diabetes is always desired for a clinically meaningful outcome. Around  50 % of all people suffering from diabetes are undiagnosed because of its long-term asymptomatic phase.

This dataset contains  520  observations with  17  characteristics, collected using direct questionnaires and diagnosis results from the patients in the Sylhet Diabetes Hospital in Sylhet, Bangladesh.
